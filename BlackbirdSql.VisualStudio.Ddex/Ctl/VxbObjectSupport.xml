	<!--
	This is messy but no way around it.

	xs:sequence is specified so Element Definitions have to come first.
	Most top level nodes include a Columns subset so these are parameterized.

	Triggers
		Firstly we want to list triggers in a folder at the top level within a database;
			IOW the trigger is the hierarchy root.
		But we also want to list triggers within each table;
			In this case the table is the hierarchy root.
		Whichever is the case, we want to list any dependency columns of the trigger,
			those being a subset of the table's columns.
		Further we want to differentiate between system & user for...
			tables, triggers, sequences(generators) and possibly others.

		All of these situations create a commonality of nodes so everything is
		parameterized, which makes for poor readability unfortunately.
