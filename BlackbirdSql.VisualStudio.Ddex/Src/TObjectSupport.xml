	<!-- Element Definitions
			xs:sequence is specified so this has to come first
			so we're going to keep definitions limited and simple
			otherwise it's just going to become a pita
	-->

	<!--
	A little messy here.
		Firstly we want to list triggers in a folder at the top level within a database;
			IOW the trigger is the hierarchy root.
		But we also want to list triggers within each table;
			In this case the table is the hierarchy root.
		Whichever is the case, we want to list any dependency columns of the trigger,
			those being a subset of the table's columns.
		Further we want to differentiate between system & user...
			tables, triggers, sequences(generators) and possibly others.

		All of these situations create a commonality of nodes so it seems we're progressively
		heading towards what MS has done with SqlServer where evrything is parameterized, which
		we wanted to avoid simply because the readability is awful.

		TBC: Other column types will be included in these defines
